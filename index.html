            <p>Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. It doesn't look so shiny to me. Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped.</p>
            <p>Shut up and get to the point! Really?! Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. <strong> No!</strong> <em> Don't jump!</em> Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies.</p>
            <h2>And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.</h2>
            <p>Why not indeed! Bender, we're trying our best. Fry, we have a crate to deliver. And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here.</li><li>I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared…</li><li>It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?</li>

            <p>I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. Actually, that's still true. Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Kif might! You're going to do his laundry?</p>
            <ul>
            <li>You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see!</li><li>You know, I was God once.</li><li>You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head."</p>
            <p>Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see!</p>
            <p>You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?</p>
            <p>For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here.</p>
            <p>Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! Oh God, what have I done? Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?</p>
            <p>Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.</p>
            <p>Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!</p>
            <p>With gusto. Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? Then we'll go with that data file! I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan!</p>
            <p>Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! You're going to do his laundry? Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.</p>
            <p>Why yes! Thanks for noticing. We're also Santa Claus! Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood!</p>
            <p>Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. Noooooo! For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.</p>
